# HR-Employee-Attribution
*Goal*: Predict and understand factors influencing employee turnover.

## Business Problem:
Employee attrition is a significant challenge for HR departments, as it leads to higher recruitment and training costs. The company aims to:
- Identify patterns and reasons behind employee turnover.
- Predict which employees are likely to leave.
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce attrition.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze an HR dataset to determine the factors that contribute to employee attrition and create a predictive model to foresee future attrition. Through the analysis, insights will be provided to assist HR in improving retention strategies.
